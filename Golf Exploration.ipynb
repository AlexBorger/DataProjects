    "Hello to any and all who may be viewing my research!  I would like to personally thank you for taking the time to join me as I dive deep into my scorecards. I will try to turn my recorded data into insights that I can use to become a better golfer.  I may not need to do this to know where my strengths and weaknesses are, but I might be able to gain insight into where I should consider pouring my efforts to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, I should explain a little about myself.  I am 22 years old, 6'3'' and 370 lbs (down 100 since Jan '17!!).  I have been playing golf ever since my dad took me to the driving range when I was 9.  I first broke 100 on a full round of golf when I was 14 years old, and broke 90 when I was 19.  If there's any linearity to this, I have another couple of years before I should expect to break 80 (best is still 83!).  With bariatric surgery looming around the corner (8/16/17), it might be a little tough to expect it to come this season.  However, I'm hoping that as I lose the weight, my swing will naturally improve due to less resistance, my energy level will rise and my scores will go down as a result.  In the meantime, I often wonder which area of my game requires the most work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Game (4 iron to driver)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mid Game (Gap wedge to 5 iron)\n",
    "\n",
    "Short Game (Sand wedge or closer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting (any strokes from the putting surface)\n",
    "\n",
    "To give ourselves an idea of how golfers can quantify their performance in these areas, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND visiting this fantastic article:  https://mygolfspy.com/2016-report-overall-golfer-performance-by-handicap/\n",
    "This website uses a database of over 400,000 golf rounds to calculate a number of KPIs.  The KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for the areas mentioned above are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Game: FIR % (Fairways in Regulation %)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mid Game & Short Game: GIR % (Greens in Regulation %)\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting: Putts per Round\n",
    "\n",
    "(Bonus:  Round scoring, handicap)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I never felt the need to pay $35 to get a Golfer Identification Number and a login to have an official handicap, (since I have not yet considered playing professionally or in tournaments...) so I am stuck with having to calculate my own golfer's handicap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  Handicap is a metric that golfers use to identify overall skill.  Any amateur tournament is going to be separated into tiers based on handicap.  After all, it's not fair to let a 3 handicap golfer play a 20 handicap golfer on a level playing field.  This would be analogous to allowing 150-lb and 290-lb wrestlers go head-to-head.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This being said, a quick glance at the information on MyGolfSpy (link above) will give you an idea of how golfers, grouped by handicap, perform on the KPIs that follow.  Using this information, I hope to identify in which skill category I belong as well as where I lack relative to other golfers.  \n",

Golf is a funny game where a 300-yard drive, a 175-yard approach to the green, a 20-foot putt and a 6-inch tap-in all count equally towards your score.

Now, of course, this almost *never* happens,  as we'll later discuss GIR % for scratch golfers and how it's surprisingly low.

    "You might be wondering, why \"slope\"?  Why is the average 113?  Why not just add $N$ strokes to everyone's card and say the course handicap is just simply $N$?  Well, to answer these questions in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)  Just look here.  http://www.leaderboard.com/abcs.htm  This explains a LOT about slope.\n",
    "(2)  Go here.  http://www.ongolfhandicaps.com/2014/07/why-is-113-in-slope-handicap-system.html  The United States Golf Association has some fairly bureaucratic rules governing the game.  The reason why the average slope is 113 is... **par for the course** (heh...).\n",
    "(3)  If you took a quick peek at the articles referenced above, it's clear that the issues that face great golfers and bogey golfers can be pretty different.  For example, narrower fairways with trees on either side might not be a problem for a scratch golfer, but could be devastating for a 25-handicap golfer who struggles to hit the ball straight.  It's not fair to simply add a constant number to everyone's handicap, since a tough course might yield five extra strokes from a bogey golfer and only two from a scratch golfer.  To compensate for this, we use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$CH = H * (S/113)$  where CH is a golfer's course handicap, H is the golfer's handicap and S is the course slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, there is a much more complex formula used to calculate a golfer's true course handicap, but this formula is a good enough approximation.  For more info on the true formula, you can visit this page: http://golfsoftware.com/hsd/golf-handicap-formula.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now... based on this information about slopes, how might we give a more accurate representation of my average normalized score?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply invert the formula from before to retrieve an expected score on a 113 slope course.  Doing so would put all scores on a level playing field of difficulty as well as a leveled course par.  The only real issue with this is:  **I don't have a handicap!!!**  This makes calculating my **true normalized** average score tricky.  Let's hold off on this section until a little further down.  For now, I think it's time we compare my results from earlier to MyGolfSpy's charts..."

My FIR % is literally off the charts.  Based on this data alone, I would say it's safe to assume that I am playing golf at roughly a **13 handicap skill level**.  Does this mean I'm actually a 13 handicapper?  No.  But, it does accurately describe my playing *as of late*.\n",

Needless to say, I should be straightening out my shots from the tees.  But it would be overly simplistic to think that learning to hit my driver straight will fix my fairway woes completely;  I need to learn proper **course management**.  Every golf hole can be played several ways, and a smart golfer will learn how to navigate them safely.  If you know you're hitting your driver left lately but you've been smashing your 4-iron consistently down the middle of the fairway, it would be smarter to use a 4-iron on the tee than a driver, especially if there's trouble on the left, or if the hole has a dogleg right.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  I believe that the #1 thing I can do to improve my score is to put the ball in the fairway and in good position to the hole.  If I can give myself more chances to get the ball on the green, I can give myself more opportunities to make pars.  And after all, pars are a great score on any hole."
