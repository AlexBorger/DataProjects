# DataProjects

This repository contains my personal data exploration.  There are three projects so far:  Credit Card Fraud Detector, Weight Data EDA and Golf score EDA.  

The fraud detector is my capstone project for IBM's Advanced Data Science specialization on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm?.  I had a lot of fun putting this together - Andrea Dal Pozzolo's work is quite robust and highlights some pretty interesting ideas about how to handle imbalanced data in machine learning.  He suggests that there may not be a shoo-in 'best model' for any given classification task.  Instead, he offers a racing method that I like to compare to Grease's dance-off:  Everyone gets a chance, but as underperformers are identified, they are tapped on the shoulder and have to leave the dance floor.  At the end, the best method remains the victor (much like Danny and Cha Cha, to Sandy's chagrin)!  His work is obviously well beyond the scope of this project, so I only compare two methods (random forest and dense NN).

For the latter two, there is an Excel spreadsheet associated with both scripts.  The names of the files should be self-explanatory.  You may have to change the working directory in the R script to access the Excel spreadsheet if you want to see the weight graph.  The Jupyter Notebook script has already been executed so there is no need to access the golf spreadsheet through the script in order to see the results.  If you have any questions about the data or have any suggestions/opinions, feel free to email me at alexborger3@gmail.com .  

Thanks for reading!

Sincerely,
Alex Borger
