# DataProjects

This repository contains my personal data exploration.  There are two projects so far:  Weight data and Golf scores.  There is an Excel spreadsheet associated with both scripts.  The names of the files should be self-explanatory.  You may have to change the working directory in the R script to access the Excel spreadsheet if you want to see the weight graph.  The Jupyter Notebook script has already been executed so there is no need to access the golf spreadsheet through the script in order to see the results.  If you have any questions about the data or have any suggestions/opinions, feel free to email me at alexborger3@gmail.com .  

Thanks for reading!

Sincerely,
Alex Borger
